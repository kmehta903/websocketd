Have websocketd installed!

Enter the following at the command line once inside the websocketd/examples/bash folder:
websocketd --port=8080 --staticdir=. ./RandomData.sh

Navigate to the following in the browser:
http://localhost:8080/Canvas.html

NOTE: Due to inherent entropy issues, data may not always be random each time "Fill Canvas" button is clicked
